  <h2>Historical Leaders</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last two centuries, a number of Sudhan chiefs, political organizers, and military commanders
    have played visible roles in regional events. Many of their names appear in accounts of the Poonch
    uprisings and in the early political history of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. This site does not attempt an
    exhaustive biographical dictionary but recognizes the importance of such figures in Sudhan collective
    memory.

  <h2>Modern Political &amp; Military Figures</h2>
  <p>
    Sudhans have held senior positions in the political institutions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including
    roles such as legislators, party leaders, and heads of government. The community is also strongly
    represented among officers and soldiers in the armed forces. These positions both reflect and reinforce
    the tribe&apos;s reputation for organizational capacity and martial tradition.

  <h2>Scholars, Professionals &amp; Diaspora Voices</h2>
  <p>
    Education and migration have enabled growing numbers of Sudhans to work as academics, doctors, engineers,
    businesspeople, and community organizers. In the diaspora, Sudhan individuals contribute to local society
    while also maintaining links to their places of origin through philanthropy, political engagement, and
    cultural activities.
