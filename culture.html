  <h2>Language</h2>
  <p>
    Most Sudhans speak varieties of Pahari–Pothwari, a north–western Indo–Aryan language continuum that spans
    parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and northern Punjab. Urdu is also widely used, particularly in education,
    administration, and media. Some family and clan names preserve echoes of older Pashto–linked or Rajput
    vocabulary, reflecting the layered history of the community.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Religion &amp; Beliefs</h2>
  <p>
    The Sudhans are overwhelmingly Muslim, predominantly following Sunni traditions. Sufi influences, including
    reverence for saints and shrines, have historically been important. Local pirs, religious teachers, and
    mosque leaders often play roles not only in spiritual guidance but also in community dispute resolution and
    mobilization.

  <h2>Traditional Customs</h2>
  <p>
    Many customary practices are shared with neighboring hill communities: arranged marriages, extended family
    households, strong concern with honor (<em>izzat</em>), and hospitality toward guests. Weddings may involve
    drumming, folk songs, and communal feasts, while funerary and religious observances combine Islamic practice
    with localized ritual patterns.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Social Organization</h2>
  <p>
    Sudhan society is structured around clans and lineages, sometimes referred to as <em>khels</em> or sub–tribes.
    These kin groups influence marriage choices, political alliances, and patterns of mutual assistance. Village
   –level leadership has traditionally rested with elders who command respect through experience, character, and
    the ability to mediate conflicts.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Arts, Narrative &amp; Everyday Life</h2>
  <p>
    Storytelling, oral history, and poetry are important carriers of Sudhan memory. Accounts of past conflicts,
    notable ancestors, and journeys abroad circulate in family gatherings and community events. Everyday life
    combines agricultural work, wage labor, education, and, increasingly, digital and transnational connections
    that link rural villages to cities and overseas communities.
