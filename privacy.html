      <p>
        This website is an independent, informational resource focused on the Sudhan people, their history, culture,

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Cookies &amp; Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        The site may use cookies or similar technologies to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable basic site functionality</li>
        <li>Remember preferences where applicable</li>

      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        The site may use analytics tools such as Google Analytics or similar services. These tools help understand how

        <li>Rough geographic region based on IP address</li>
        <li>Type of device and browser</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Analytics services typically use cookies and may store information on servers located in various countries.
        Data used for analytics is generally processed in aggregated, non-personally identifiable form.
      </p>
      <p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
      <p>
        This site may be hosted on a static hosting platform such as GitHub Pages or similar providers. Contact form
        submissions may be delivered via email, or through third-party form handling services, depending on the
        configuration chosen by the site maintainer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasonable measures are taken to protect the information that passes through or is stored in connection with the
        site, including the use of HTTPS and secure email accounts where applicable. However, no method of transmission
        or storage is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The site may rely on third-party services, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Static hosting providers (e.g., GitHub Pages)</li>
        <li>Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics)</li>
        <li>Form handling or email delivery services (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms, or similar)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These providers may process data on servers located in different countries and are responsible for their own
        privacy and security practices. Your use of the site may therefore also be subject to their terms and policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Personal information submitted via the contact form is retained only for as long as reasonably necessary to
        respond to your inquiry, maintain basic records, or comply with any applicable obligations. Technical and
        analytics data may be retained in aggregated form for longer periods to support site maintenance and research.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the
        right to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Request access to the information held about you</li>
        <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
        <li>Request deletion of your personal information where appropriate</li>
        <li>Withdraw any consent you have previously provided</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise these rights, please contact the site maintainer using the email address listed below. Reasonable
        efforts will be made to honor such requests in line with technical capabilities and any applicable legal
        requirements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Because hosting providers, analytics platforms, and email services may use servers located in various
        countries, your information may be transferred across national borders. By using the site, you consent to
        such transfers to the extent they are necessary to provide the site&apos;s functionality.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. Children&apos;s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This site is not directed toward children under the age of 13, and personal information is not knowingly
        collected from children in that age group. If you believe that a child under 13 has submitted information
        through the contact form, please get in touch so the information can be removed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        handling practices, or applicable regulations. The &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this page
        indicates the current version. Continued use of the site after any changes are posted will signify acceptance
