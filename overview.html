  <h2>Identity &amp; Definition</h2>
  <p>
    The Sudhans are a hill–country people whose core homeland lies in and around the Poonch region of
    the western Himalayas, especially within today&apos;s Azad Jammu and Kashmir. They are often described
    as a &quot;tribe&quot; or &quot;clan–based community&quot; rather than a nationality in the modern sense,
    but in many local and diasporic contexts they function as an ethnicity with a strong shared identity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Self–identification commonly uses names such as <em>Sudhan</em>, <em>Sudhans</em>, or variants linked
    to the Sadozai/Sudhozai label, while external descriptions in colonial, princely–state, and modern
    scholarship may emphasize their role as a martial, politically active community in the Poonch belt.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Names &amp; Terminology</h2>
  <p>
    Several overlapping names are encountered in the literature and in local usage. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sudhan / Sudhans</strong> – the most common English rendering of the group name.</li>
    <li><strong>Sadozai / Sudhozai</strong> – used in some traditions to link the community to a Pashtun Durrani clan.</li>
    <li><strong>Sudhan Tribe</strong> – frequent in colonial and administrative records, emphasizing tribal structure.</li>
    <li><strong>Sudhan biradari</strong> – in Urdu and Pahari–Pothwari contexts, highlighting kinship and brotherhood.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    It is important to distinguish between <em>self–chosen names</em> and labels applied by others. For example,
    certain genealogical, Pashtun–origin narratives are strongly affirmed by some Sudhan lineages, while others
    emphasize regional Pahari identity or connections to Rajput or local hill–chief traditions.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Geographic Distribution (Snapshot)</h2>
  <p>
    The largest concentrations of Sudhans are found in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Poonch, Sudhanoti, Bagh, and parts of Kotli districts in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.</li>
    <li>Adjacent areas of northern Punjab, including Rawalpindi and Murree regions.</li>
    <li>Historic and contemporary diaspora communities in Pakistan&apos;s major cities.</li>
    <li>Overseas communities in the United Kingdom, the Gulf, and North America.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Population figures vary between sources and are often estimates, since many censuses record broader
    regional or linguistic categories rather than specific tribal or biradari identities.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Internal Diversity</h2>
  <p>
    Within the Sudhan community, there are multiple clans, lineages, and regional sub–groups. These may differ
    in their preferred origin narratives, local customs, and levels of urbanization or diaspora experience.
    Rather than a single, uniform block, Sudhans can be thought of as a network of interconnected hill and
    migrant communities sharing a strong name, reputation, and sense of solidarity.
