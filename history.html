  <h2>Early Origins &amp; Formation</h2>
  <p>
    The earliest phases of Sudhan history are difficult to reconstruct with precision. Various traditions
    link the community to Afghan Pashtun lineages such as the Sadozai, to Rajput hill chiefs, or to long–standing
    Pahari populations that gradually coalesced into a named tribe. It is likely that Sudhan identity emerged
    over time from multiple streams rather than from a single founder ancestor.
  </p>
  <p>
    What most accounts agree on is that by the early modern period, Sudhans were recognized as a distinct
    martial community inhabiting the hill tracts around Poonch, with a reputation for courage, autonomy, and
    sometimes for defiance of outside rule.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>18th &amp; 19th Centuries</h2>
  <p>
    In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the political landscape of the region shifted repeatedly.
    Power moved between Afghan, Sikh, and eventually Dogra rulers. The 1846 Treaty of Amritsar transferred
    sovereignty over Jammu and Kashmir to the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh, and Poonch became a jagir held by
    his relatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Sudhans, this brought new forms of taxation, administrative control, and compulsory labor. Colonial
    and princely–state records from the later nineteenth century often describe Sudhans as independent–minded,
    difficult to govern, and prone to resist revenue demands. This image reflects genuine friction but also
    the point of view of rulers and officials trying to extend their authority into a rugged hill region.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Early 20th Century &amp; Political Mobilization</h2>
  <p>
    In the early twentieth century, wider currents of political reform and anti–autocratic sentiment in
    the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir also reached Poonch. Sudhans, already experienced in local
    struggles over taxation and autonomy, were well positioned to play a leading role in petitions, protests,
    and, eventually, armed resistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Educational opportunities, military service, and contact with broader political movements further
    sharpened Sudhan awareness of their position within the Dogra state and their capacity to act collectively.
  </p>

  <h2>Poonch Uprisings &amp; 1947–48</h2>
  <p>
    In the mid–1940s, tensions in the Poonch region escalated sharply, fueled by wartime demobilization,
    economic hardship, and longstanding grievances. Sudhan ex–servicemen and local leaders played a central
    part in the uprisings that broke out against the Dogra regime. These events were closely intertwined with
    the wider 1947–48 conflict over the future of Jammu and Kashmir.
  </p>
  <p>
    The participation of Sudhan fighters in these struggles became a core element of modern Sudhan collective
    memory. Many later accounts emphasize sacrifice, organizational capacity, and the tribe&apos;s role in the
    creation of what became Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Post–1947 Developments</h2>
  <p>
    After the ceasefire and the division of the former princely state, Sudhans remained concentrated in the
    Azad Jammu and Kashmir territory. They have continued to be prominent in local politics, in the armed
    forces, and in public administration. Electoral politics in several districts regularly highlights the
    influence of Sudhan biradari networks.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the same time, modernization, migration, and education have diversified Sudhan livelihoods and life
    trajectories. The tribe today includes farmers, soldiers, civil servants, professionals, entrepreneurs,
    and diaspora communities whose experience spans multiple countries and social worlds.
