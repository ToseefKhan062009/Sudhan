  <h2>Critical Perspectives &amp; Biased Accounts</h2>
  <p>
    Some historical and contemporary sources portray Sudhans in sharply critical terms, emphasizing episodes
    of rebellion, conflict, or factional politics. Others, from different standpoints, idealize the tribe
    as uniformly heroic or uniquely virtuous. Both types of portrayal can be selective and should be read
    with attention to who is writing, for what audience, and in what political context.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
  <p>
    Misconceptions about Sudhans often arise from generalizing a particular episode or stereotype to the whole
    community. For example, a period of armed revolt may be used to claim that Sudhans are inherently violent
    or ungovernable, while individual cases of corruption or factional rivalry may be inflated into sweeping
    judgments. The historical record shows a much more complex picture that includes cooperation, institution–
    building, and everyday life alongside moments of confrontation.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Debated Origins &amp; Identities</h2>
  <p>
    One major area of debate concerns the ultimate origins of the Sudhans: whether they are best understood
    as descended from Pashtun Sadozai lineages, from Rajput hill chiefs, from indigenous Pahari populations,
    or from some combination. Different authors and family traditions place different weight on each of these
    elements. Rather than choose one definitive answer, this site highlights the evidence and acknowledges
    that Sudhan identity has likely been formed through multiple historical layers.

<section>
  <h2>Synthesis &amp; Approach of this Site</h2>
  <p>
    The guiding principle here is to separate description of what sources <em>say</em> from evaluation of how
    reliable those sources are. Where a particular book or article makes strong claims, the aim is to summarize
    those claims fairly while also noting their limitations, biases, or omissions when these are visible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, any account of Sudhan history and culture is a work in progress. New research, newly available
    archives, and the voices of community members themselves will continue to refine and, where necessary,
    correct older narratives.
