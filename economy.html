  <h2>Historical Economy</h2>
  <p>
    Historically, Sudhan livelihoods centered on small–scale agriculture, animal husbandry, and service in
    mainly in the Pakistani military. Terraced fields supported cereals, legumes, and fodder crops, while livestock
    provided milk, draft power, and, occasionally, marketable surplus. Seasonal migration for work, military
    service, or trade linked the hill communities to lowland markets.

  <h2>Modern Livelihoods</h2>
  <p>
    In the contemporary period, Sudhans are active in a wide range of occupations. Many still farm, but there
    is also significant representation in the armed forces, police, civil service, education, transport, small
    business, and skilled trades. Remittances from diaspora workers, particularly in the Gulf and the United
    Kingdom, play a role in supporting households and local development projects.

  <h2>Patterns of Change</h2>
  <p>
    Economic change has brought both opportunities and challenges. Income from overseas labor and urban
    employment can improve housing, education, and social status, but it may also contribute to inequalities
    between households, as well as to new expectations regarding lifestyle and consumption. At the same time,
    environmental pressures and limited local resources continue to shape life in the hill regions.
