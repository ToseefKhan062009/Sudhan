    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a structured, documentary-style overview of the Sudhan people,
      a historically significant tribe centered in the Poonch District of the western
      Himalayas and in today&apos;s Azad Kashmir of Pakistan. It brings together
      material from encyclopedias, historical works, colonial sources, modern
      scholarship, and community narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not advocacy for or against any particular narrative, but rather
      a careful mapping of what has been written <em>about</em> Sudhans, how Sudhans
      describe themselves, and where sources agree or disagree.

  <h2>Method and Sources</h2>
  <p>
    This project treats sources as <strong>data</strong> rather than as unquestioned truth. Where possible,
    it notes the author, time period, and perspective behind a claim. Contradictions are not hidden;
    they are placed side by side and discussed in a dedicated section on controversies and biases.
  </p>
  <p>
    Readers are encouraged to treat this site as a starting point for further research, not as a final
    verdict. Primary sources, academic works, and community testimony all have a place here, but they
    are marked and, where appropriate, questioned.
